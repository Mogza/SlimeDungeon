## What is Slime Dungeon ?
Slime dungeon is a game (in the style of a pay to earn) in which the user receives a slime upon arrival.
The goal is to raise the level of his slime in order to be able to divide it and have as much slimes as possible. 

For this, there are several ways to xp his slime :
1. Get Xp Bottle by exploring dungeon : Theses dungeon can be done only once per days and per slimes.
2. Pay ^^

Once our slime is at the maximum level, we can split it up in two little slimes (Lvl 2).
